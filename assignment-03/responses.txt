1. An IP address is a digital location of a system on the internet. DNS allow ip addresses to be associated with human readable domain names and also connect users with said websites/systems
2. Cookie's are blocks of data created by web servers as a way to store information. These can range from data that is used in places such as shopping or login info to cookies which are used to track a user's browsing history
3. An Internet URL is composed of 4 essential components. These are the Protocol (http:// or https:// usually), which dictates how the browser will communicate with the web server the site is hosted on. The second is the Domain (an example would be youtube.com), which is a unique identifier for your website. The third are the paths, which are instructions on how to navigate the directories of the web server to arrive at the needed file (dictated by the the slashes after the domain). The final part is the actual file, which is simply usually a file name (such as picture.png or index.html).
