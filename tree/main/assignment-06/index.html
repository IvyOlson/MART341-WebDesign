        <h1> The Emperor </h1>
        <p> <q>In a distant fantasy realm, both alike and dissimilar to our own, a man of great import makes a descision that will change the world as he knows it. </q> </p>
        <p> <cite>The Emperor</cite> follows <strong>Leon Sucheres</strong>, High Magister of the largest republic in the realm. Confronted by the members of his inner council, his <em>Curia Magistri</em>, he must make a descision that is as nessecary as it is terrifying. </p>
        <p> The Cast is as follows: </p>
        <dl>
            <dt> <strong>Leon Sucheres</strong> </dt>
                <dd> A strong-willed human in his late 60s, Leon acts as both the spiritual and political head of his country. Despite his stern exterior, he hides a deep insecurity over his lasting image and wants to be remembered as more than just a "boring peacetime high magister". </dd>
            <dt> <strong>Villia Netsera</strong> </dt>
                <dd> A wise, caring Elf going on 160, Villia is the current reigning duchess of one of the republics largest provinces. Although she receives her share of doubt (and sometimes bigotry) from her fellow magisters, she tries her best to give a brighter future for the people of her nation. A future, she hopes, will accept her as it would any other.</dd>
            <dt> <strong>Theodore Hill-Guard</strong> </dt>
                <dd> A young and bright human in his early 30s, Theodore acts as the spearhead of the new guard in the government. Inheriting his position from his widely lauded father, Theodore uses this favorable reputation to make alliances and further his goals. Although his methods may seem distasteful, he has the good of the realm at heart. Or so he claims. </dd>
            <dt> <strong>Lady Adina Braun</strong> </dt>
                <dd> An up-and-coming youthful human in her late 20s, Lady Adina Braun is the latest in a long line of famed northern lords who guard the republic from threats nestled safely in the frigid province of New Teutania. Full of humor and a biting wit to boot, Lady Braun hides a cunning that will just as much make you smile as it will stab you in the back. </dd>
            <dt> <strong>Lord-Seigneur Xixao Seyong</strong> </dt>
                <dd> A nervous yet resourceful human in his late 20s, Lord-Seigneur Xixao Seyong is the elected representative of the massive frontier regions in the eastern republic. His territory, being as big as it is, provides much anxiety to the burgeoning lord. In an attempt to assuage his worries, and secure his own power, he has taken up with a group that has... <em>unsavory</em> aims. </dd>
