Here is a screenshot of my work! [Screenshot](images/Screenshot.png)

1. A universal selector allows you to style every element on a page. An element selector allows you to style one specific type of element. A class selector allows you to style a group of elements, usually with a similar function. An ID selector allows you to style a specific element by assigning it a specific ID. These allow you to create a "pallette" that selects specific elements and moves them in ways you specifically desire!

2. I chose the colors because I really wanted to get a sort of "sea feel" for the color pallette. I wanted to play around with some lighter, desaturated greens and cyans and I felt like I picked some good examples!

3. As weird as it sounds, I ran into signifigant difficulty centering the content. I obviously managed to, but it was certainley weird.
