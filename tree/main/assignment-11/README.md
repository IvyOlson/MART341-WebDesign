Here is a screenshot of my work! [Screenshot](images/Screenshot.png)

1. Typography is the design skill of making font readable and fitting to a design vision! This goes beyond simple font selection and into the realm of making sure that paragraphs are properly spaced, sized, and that a font is at the proper size and weight for a reader!

2. Having fallback fonts allows your site to work properly on multiple browsers and systems in which said font may not read well or is inaccessible by the browser or system!

3. A system font is a font that is preinstalled on almost every machine, and is the most accesible type of font. Web Fonts are fonts that are installed in most browsers, while "web safe" fonts are fonts that are safe to use in most services due to their readability and prevalence.
