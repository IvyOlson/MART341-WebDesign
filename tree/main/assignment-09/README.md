Here is a screenshot of my work! [Screenshot](images/Screenshot.png)

1. I knew a fair amount of HTML before I started this course, however this course taught me quite a large amount about the nitty gritty of HTML itself! I learned a lot of new stuff about properties of tags and how to incorporate newer HTML-5 elements into a web design.

2. I am a bit anxious about learning mobile CSS design, but i'm sure this course will properly teach it!
